Allied market research shows a market size of 700 Billion. seems it should be higher to me.

Number of users, number of kyc'd users, number of transactions, volume of transactions

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Still in the early stages of startup compared to every other payments company. Business wise they aren't able to compete with Paypal and the likes. But as crypto adoption continues, they have the first mover advantage in this space. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I'd like to better understand what in their services has made them be a non self custody wallet app.  If they could offer a solution to on and off ramp fiat with a user self custody wallet. that would be stellar. If their services require full custody of the funds. Then I'd recommend that they offer an integration into a traditional private wallet if they won't provide their own secondary private wallet. 

Currently withdrawal of USD to user's bank account takes 1-3 days. If they could make that instant like coinbase. 

It's hard for me to test multi-fiat currency. I believe they offer different currency support, but I'd need to be in the country to receive and use it. As an American it would be helpful if I could chose to buy whatever fiat currency I'd want. I understand there would be some banking considerations here. but if they're the custodian of the funds. Then they'd be the only one's that would require to have the accounts. I know they want to make instant bankless transactions across the world using bitcoin. But I think they could capture more marketshare if they allowed instant payments in foreign currencies as well. Unless foreign users already have this capability in the application, which I can't currently test. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I think these proposals add security and peace of mind to consumers. While also increasing adoption and use cases. Many companies that were custodians of crypto went bankrupt this year and caused serious harm to millions of users. Some of these users will not enter the crypto space again. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

I think relationships with traditional banking and technology integrations built between these partnerships. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

I want to see bitcoin become the world reserve currency. But I think we are a long way away from it. I think Strike is one of the first companies to make use of bitcoin as the transactional base layer for their technology. And this is how I see the future as well. But we are still early in the space and it will be difficult to onboard the next 100 - 500  million users if the product only transacts in USD or BTC. I'd think the product should be more encompassing of current fiat processing.  So that it can have a huge part in weening the general population off of fiat.
